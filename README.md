Roots - Shopify Template
========================

This is a simplified [Shopify](http://shopify.com/) theme to be used as a "blank slate" starting point for theme designers.  

It is based off of [Shopify/skeleton-theme](https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme) but is ported to utilize a [Roots](http://roots.cx/) workflow.

### Setup
- Install [roots](http://roots.cx/#installation)
- Run the following commands from your command line:
  - `roots template add shopify https://github.com/kylemac/roots-shopify`
  - `roots new store-name --shopify`
  - `cd store-name`
  - `roots watch`
- Write code
- Profit!
