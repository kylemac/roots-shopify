  Re-use the "rte" class wherever you output content that was added by a merchant using
  the Rich Text Editor ( 'rte' stands for rich text editor ).
  Style all HTML elements in that content the same way across the board.
  Use the 'rte' class in your CSS to help maintain that consistency.
  Example: the h2 element should have the same size and color in:
  - product descriptions
  - collection descriptions
  - "page pages" content
  - blog post
{% assign page = pages.frontpage %}

.rte
  {{ page.content }}

{% assign collection = collections.frontpage %}

ul.grid.clearfix
{% for product in collection.products %}
{% include "product-grid-item" with "three-per-row" %}
{% else %}
:markdown
  You have no products in your Frontpage collection. [Add some.](http://www.shopify.com/admin/custom_collections)
{% endfor %}
